 This project can calculate the hash of a character string
 
# Hash Calculator

This Python script allows you to calculate the hash of a given text using different hashing algorithms such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.

## Features

- Supports multiple hashing algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- Takes user input for the text and the algorithm.
- Returns the hash value based on the selected algorithm.

## Installation

To use this script, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The script uses the `hashlib` library, which is included in Python's standard library, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script by executing:

```bash
python hash_calculator.py
